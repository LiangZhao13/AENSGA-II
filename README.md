# Data-for-AENSGA-II
This is the official data for our manuscript: Multi-objective path planning for unmanned surface vehicles using adaptive enhanced non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (AENSGA-II) with fuzzy inference selector. 
 

### Requirements:
MATLAB 2021a is prefered.\
The Navigational Toolbox package is required.

### How to use it?
To start using the data, run the file [plotres.m](https://github.com/LiangZhao13/Data-for-path-plannning-considering-multi-modality-constraint/blob/main/plotres.m) to generate all the figures that related to the article.\
Run the file [energyConsume.m](https://github.com/LiangZhao13/Data-for-path-plannning-considering-multi-modality-constraint/blob/main/energyConsume.m) to calculate the energy consumption for each case.\
Run the [appendix.m](https://github.com/LiangZhao13/Data-for-path-plannning-considering-multi-modality-constraint/blob/main/appendix.m) file, the results generated by the USV model simulations are presented.\
